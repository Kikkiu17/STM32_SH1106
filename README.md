# STM32_SH1106
A simple library for using an I2C SH1106 display with STM32.

## Example
(Ignoring HAL autogenerated code)
```
int main(void)
{
  char text[] = "Hello World";
  SH1106_Init();
  SH1106_DrawHollowRect(29, 23, 68, 18, 2, BLUE);
  SH1106_WriteChars(32, 25, text, sizeof(text), Arial_12pt);
  SH1106_UpdateScreen();
}
```

You can also turn ON/OFF the display with `SH1106_DisplayON()` and `SH1106_DisplayOFF()`. For other functions, see the library header file `Inc/sh1106.h`.

## Font generation
"The Dot Factory" has been used to generate the fonts (http://www.eran.io/the-dot-factory-an-lcd-font-and-image-generator/). With this program, you can generate bitmaps for any font you like. The only setting that you have to modify is "rotation": you have to put it to "90Â°", otherwise the font won't be printed correctly. Everything else can be left as-is - for more info check the readme file in `Src`.

## Bitmap images
You can use any program to generate bitmaps for an image. For this project, I specifically used "LCD Assistant". The byte orientation has to be set to Vertical, with 8 pixels per byte. For more info check the readme file in `Src`.
